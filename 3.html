<h3>Meditation이란 무엇인가?</h3>
<p><strong><u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meditation" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">Meditation</a></u></strong> is a practice in which an individual uses a technique
– such as mindfulness, or focusing the mind on a particular object, thought,
 or activity – to train attention and awareness, and achieve a mentally
  clear and emotionally calm and stable state.</p>

<p><strong>Meditation</strong> is practiced in numerous religious traditions.
The earliest records of meditation (dhyana) are found in the Upanishads
of Hindu philosophy, and meditation plays a salient role in the
contemplative repertoire of Buddhism and Hinduism. Since the 19th century,
 Asian meditative techniques have spread to other cultures where they have
 also found application in non-spiritual contexts, such as business and
  health.</p><style="maegin-top:40px;">
<p> Meditation may significantly reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and pain,
 and enhance peace, perception, self-concept, and well-being.
  Research is ongoing to better understand the effects of meditation on
  health (psychological, neurological, and cardiovascular) and other areas.</p>
